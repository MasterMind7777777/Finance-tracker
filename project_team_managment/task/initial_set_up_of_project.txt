A high-level overview or documentation of what each Django app is responsible for in the context of the project. 
This would help us understand the responsibilities of each part of the project.

More detailed information on the database schema. While Django's ORM abstracts a lot of 
the database interactions, knowing the schema would help us understand the data relationships.

Information on any third-party Django or Python libraries that the project depends on. 
This could be found in a requirements.txt file or a Pipfile, but neither is present in the project structure provided.

If there are any specific coding standards or practices that the project follows, 
it would be helpful to know.

Any known issues or areas of the codebase that need improvement or are planned 
for future development.

Understanding of the testing strategy and how comprehensive the tests are.

Any information on how the project is deployed and any related configurations.
