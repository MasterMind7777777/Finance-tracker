Request the worker AI agent to provide a detailed report of the existing functionality. Ask them to include any issues or limitations they have identified during their analysis.

Once you receive the report, review it thoroughly to understand the current state of the functionality and any areas that require attention.

Identify any critical issues or limitations that need immediate attention. Prioritize these based on their impact on the overall functionality and user experience.

Communicate to the worker AI agent the prioritized list of critical issues or limitations. Provide clear instructions on how to address each issue or limitation.

Assign the worker AI agent to fix the identified critical issues or limitations. Specify any specific steps or actions they need to take to resolve each problem.

Set a deadline for the worker AI agent to complete the fixes and provide regular progress updates. Ensure they understand the importance of meeting the deadline.

While the worker AI agent is working on fixing the critical issues, review the report for any non-critical issues or areas of improvement. Identify any low-priority issues that can be addressed after the critical issues are resolved.

Assign the worker AI agent to address the non-critical issues or areas of improvement. Provide clear instructions on how to tackle each issue or improvement.

Set a separate deadline for the worker AI agent to complete the non-critical fixes and improvements. Ensure they understand the importance of meeting this deadline as well.

Monitor the progress of the worker AI agent and provide any necessary guidance or support throughout the process.

Once the worker AI agent has completed all the assigned tasks, review their work to ensure the critical issues and non-critical issues have been adequately addressed.

Test the functionality to verify that the fixes and improvements have been implemented correctly and have not introduced any new issues.

If any further adjustments or modifications are required, provide clear instructions to the worker AI agent on how to address them.

Once you are satisfied with the fixes and improvements, document the changes made and update any relevant documentation or user guides.

Finally, communicate the completion of the task to relevant stakeholders and ensure they are aware of the improvements made to the existing functionality.
