users view
provide the following functionality:

signup: This view handles the user signup process. It renders the signup form (CustomUserCreationForm) and processes the form submission. If the form is valid, it saves the user and redirects them to the login page.

user_login: This view handles the user login process. It renders the login form (CustomAuthenticationForm) and processes the form submission. If the form is valid, it authenticates the user and logs them in. If the user is authenticated successfully, it redirects them to the dashboard page. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

user_logout: This view handles user logout. It logs out the current user and redirects them to the login page.

dashboard: This view is decorated with @login_required, which means it requires the user to be authenticated to access the dashboard page. It retrieves the logged-in user and retrieves a list of transactions associated with that user. It also renders a transaction form (TransactionForm) and handles form submission. If the form is valid, it creates a new transaction associated with the logged-in user and returns the transaction details as a JSON response.

Potential issues with the given code:

Security: The code does not implement any input validation or sanitization for user inputs. It's important to validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Error handling: The code does not handle potential exceptions or errors that may occur during form processing or database operations. It's essential to handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages to users for better user experience and debugging.

Authorization: The code does not check for authorization levels or permissions for certain actions. For example, any authenticated user can access the dashboard and create transactions. Depending on the application's requirements, it may be necessary to implement authorization checks to restrict certain actions to specific user roles or permissions.

Transaction handling: The code creates a transaction without explicitly handling the database transaction. In case of any errors or exceptions during transaction creation, the code may leave the database in an inconsistent state. It's recommended to use Django's built-in transaction management or handle transactions explicitly to ensure data consistency.

Code organization: The code could benefit from better code organization and separation of concerns. Consider moving forms, models, and utilities to separate modules for better code maintainability and readability.
