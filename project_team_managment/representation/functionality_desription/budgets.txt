budgets view
provide the following functionality:

budget_overview: This view displays an overview of the user's budget. It retrieves all transactions for the current user and calculates the total income and expenses. It also calculates the current balance by subtracting the total expenses from the total income. It retrieves the categories belonging to the user and retrieves the budget limits and expenses for each category. It renders the budget overview template with the calculated values and the category budgets. It also handles the submission of the category budget form (CategoryBudgetForm) and updates or creates the category budget for a specific category.

delete_budget: This view deletes a specific category budget based on its ID. It uses the get_object_or_404 function to retrieve the budget object and deletes it. After deletion, it redirects to the budget overview page.

Potential issues with the given code:

Error handling: The code does not handle potential exceptions or errors that may occur during form processing or database operations. It's essential to handle exceptions and provide appropriate error messages to users for better user experience and debugging.

Security: The code does not implement input validation or sanitization for user inputs. It's important to validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

Efficiency: The code retrieves all transactions for the current user and calculates the total income and expenses by filtering transactions based on the category type. This approach can be inefficient if there are a large number of transactions. It's recommended to optimize the queries by utilizing Django's queryset methods and aggregations.

Database transactions: The code does not explicitly handle the database transactions when updating or creating category budgets. It's recommended to use Django's built-in transaction management or handle transactions explicitly to ensure data consistency.

Code organization: The code could benefit from better code organization and separation of concerns. Consider moving forms, models, and utilities to separate modules for better code maintainability and readability.

Variable naming: The variable names used in the code could be more descriptive to improve code readability and understanding.
