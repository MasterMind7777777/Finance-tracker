User Management: The User model and UserProfile model handle user management. 
The User model extends Django's built-in AbstractUser, adding phone_number and 
date_of_birth fields. This is a good approach as it allows for customization of 
the user model while still leveraging Django's built-in authentication system. 
The UserProfile model is used to store additional user information, which is a common pattern in Django applications.

Transaction Management: The Transaction and Category models in the transactions app 
handle transaction management. Transactions are linked to a User and optionally to a Category. 
Transactions can also be linked to a parent transaction, which could be useful for handling 
split transactions or refunds. The Category model includes a parent_category field, allowing 
for a hierarchy of categories. This is a flexible design that should be able to handle a variety of transaction types.

Budget Management: The CategoryBudget model in the budgets app handles budget management. 
Each CategoryBudget is linked to a User and a Category, and includes a budget_limit field. 
This design allows for budgeting at the category level, which is a common approach in personal finance apps.

Analytics: The analytics app includes models for handling sticky notes (StickyNote, StickyNoteContent) 
and boards (Board, BoardStickyNote). These models seem to be designed for a note-taking or planning feature, 
rather than financial analytics. If financial analytics are a requirement for this project, additional models 
or data processing might be needed.

Social Media Integration: The SocialMediaAccount model in the users app suggests some level of social media 
integration, with each SocialMediaAccount linked to a User and including a platform and username field. 
Depending on the requirements, additional models or third-party libraries might be needed for more advanced 
social media functionality.
