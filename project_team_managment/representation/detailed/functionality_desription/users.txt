users view
provide the following functionality:

signup: This view handles the user signup process. It renders the signup form (CustomUserCreationForm) and processes the form submission. If the form is valid, it saves the user and redirects them to the login page.

user_login: This view handles the user login process. It renders the login form (CustomAuthenticationForm) and processes the form submission. If the form is valid, it authenticates the user and logs them in. If the user is authenticated successfully, it redirects them to the dashboard page. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

user_logout: This view handles user logout. It logs out the current user and redirects them to the login page.

dashboard: This view is decorated with @login_required, which means it requires the user to be authenticated to access the dashboard page. It retrieves the logged-in user and retrieves a list of transactions associated with that user. It also renders a transaction form (TransactionForm) and handles form submission. If the form is valid, it creates a new transaction associated with the logged-in user and returns the transaction details as a JSON response.
